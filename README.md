# stm32f103_uart_led
This project demonstrates the use of GPIO port and pin selection to control an LED's on/off state through commands sent from a serial terminal, such as Tera-Term. The project integrates microcontroller GPIO configuration, USART communication, and user interaction to showcase real-time LED control.
